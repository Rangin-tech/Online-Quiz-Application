# Online Quiz Application (Java Swing)

## Project Overview
This is a GUI-based Online Quiz Application developed using Core Java and Java Swing.
The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), event handling,
random question generation, and file handling.

## Features
- Java Swing based graphical user interface
- User login (username input)
- Multiple-choice questions (one at a time)
- Randomized questions on every quiz attempt
- Automatic score calculation
- Result displayed using dialog box
- File-based storage of user scores

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java Collections
- File Handling

## Project Structure
src
 ├─ Main.java
 
 ├─ Question.java
 
 ├─ User.java
 
 ├─ QuizManager.java
 
 ├─ QuizFrame.java
 
 ├─ FileUtil.java

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)
3. Compile and run `Main.java`
4. Enter username and start the quiz

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical implementation of OOP concepts
- Separation of UI and business logic
- Handling user events in Java Swing
- Using collections and file handling in real applications

## Future Enhancements
- Timer-based questions
- Difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Question loading from external file
- GUI enhancements
